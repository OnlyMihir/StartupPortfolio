# StartupPortfolio
Using Machine Learning Algorithms to predict median salary to be given to a new employee and ingest portfolios of various startups and choose the best startup among them in terms of efficient utilization of resources by a startup .


This project can be said as an internal tool to be used by a company's data analyst.

First we'll be given the option to enter the file path of the data file through which the program will ingest data of the company's 
trackrecord of all the employeesand experience of those employees in terms of years they have spend working in the respective fields.
Based upon that the program will create a salary vs experience chart using Simple Linear Regression method.Thus, we will be able to 
derive how much change in salary is observed per increase in years of experience.

Secondly,we'll be given the option to enter the file path of the data file of the various startups that are currently operating in our
company's research field.We'll ingest data of various startups of how much they've spent in marketing or R&D in the past years,and the
profits they have been able to achieve.We have used Multiple Linear Regression method to analyze which startup has performed better 
while utilizing money spent in various key areas like administrative cost.The company can then mimick some of the successful ideas 
of that startup so as to improve it's own ways of achieving it's goal.

Third,we'll be able to find the median salary to be given to a new employee who wants to join our company say in X position.
Giving a sufficient or industry standard salary means increasing productive levels of an employee and thus the company gets benefitted.
